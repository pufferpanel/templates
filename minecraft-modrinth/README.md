# Template for [Modrinth Modpacks](https://modrinth.com/modpacks)

This template allows you to easily install and play `.mrpack` modpacks, such as those available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/). It leverages [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install) by Florian HÃ¼bner ([nothub](https://github.com/nothub)) to install the modpack, following the [Modrinth documentation](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth) recommendations.

## Find `.mrpack` Link

1. **Pick a Modpack**
   - Browse or search on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpacks) for the modpack you want.

2. **Copy Download Link**
   - Once you find a pack you want, go to the download section for that pack. **Right-click the download button for the pack and click `Copy Link Address`**. Use this URL for the Modrinth URL in the template. The URL should end in `.mrpack`.

## Notes

- Ensure you select the correct Java version for your modpack. The Modrinth modpack page usually specifies the necessary Java version information.
