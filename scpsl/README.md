# SCP:SL Server Template
This template downloads the scp:sl server and runs it on the default port 7777 (you can change it).
Currently I don't yet know how to edit config files via variables so currently you can only change the port.
> [!NOTE]
> During the first startup, you must answer the questions in the server console in order for the server to start correctly.
