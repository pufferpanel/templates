Terarria - tModLoader Template

How to install mods:

1. Upload the .tmod file into the mods folder
2. Edit the enabled.json inside the mods folder

For example in my mods folder i have three mods (mod1.tmod, mod2.tmod and mod3.tmod) and so my enabled.json looks like this:
[
    "Mod1",
    "Mod2",
    "Mod3"
]

NOTE: Adding mods after the world was first created may not ever work

Do not forget to install the tModLoader also on your PC (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader) and also all the mods you installed on the server!
