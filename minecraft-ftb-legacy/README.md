Feed The Beast - Minecraft Template

ONLY FOR FTB PACKS AT OR BELOW 1.16

A modpack id and version id is needed to download the installer. It can be found by selecting the preferred modpack in the [modpack list](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack). The modpack id is then shown next to the modpack title and the version id is found under the versions tab. 

E.g. FTB Revelation 3.3.0 has the modpack id 35 and version id 143
