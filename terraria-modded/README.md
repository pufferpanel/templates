Terarria Template for latest version (0.11.8.5)

!! PUT MODS ON THE MODS FOLDER AND EDIT THE ENABLED.JSON FILE BEFORE STARTING THE WORLD DUE TO HOW IT IS GENERATED !!

If for example, you created a world and then added the calimity mod, you need to create a new world (just change the world name in settings) so that the new world generates correctly

Works out of the box

Read carefully each parameter description

!! Warning !!
You can only set World Difficulty and World Size once per World

! How to add mods? !

1 - Upload mods files (tmod)
2 - Add the file name to the enabled.json file (without the tmod extension)

Example:
I uploaded the BossChecklist.tmod and ThoriumMod.tmod to the mods folder.
I then modified the enabled.json to look like this:

[
    "BossChecklist",
    "ThoriumMod"
]
